    	  <h2>Re-charging my Career Batteries</h2>
        <div>
					<p>Three months ago, I left my engineering job without having another job lined-up. Yikes… girl, what were you thinking?</p>
					<p>As someone who planned endlessly her entire life, to make decisions only after all potential consequences had been completely and fully considered, this major life decision was no exception.</p>

					<p>I’d been working for a few years post-grad in my field of study, in-fact, I was working in the exact position I aimed to be in since starting my chemical engineering studies at Queen’s University. I was working in manufacturing engineering for a prestige Fortune 500 cosmetic company supporting the launch of products across multiple commodities… Um seriously, girl what were you thinking?</p>
					<p>I was set-up perfectly. Everything should be roses and rainbows, no? What more could I want from a day-job, if free make-up alone wasn’t enough (SERIOUSLY?!)? </p>

									<i class="fas fa-umbrella"></i>

					<p>It wasn’t a new feeling, arriving to work and feeling immediate dread for the day ahead, just one that I had been supressing for quite a while. I’ve always been a ‘just-get-it-done’ personality type (to a fault, I must clean my cookware before I’ve even eaten and enjoyed my meal) so I was having a mini identity-crisis when I found myself procrastinating at work. Not just with the assumed culprits of cumbersome tasks, but even seemingly mundane and minor <em>To-Do’s</em>.</p>
					<p>I was fortunate to have a manager who was approachable. When we both knew something wasn’t right, I began facing some truths she provided in feedback that I might have previously denied. I didn’t want to face the fact that perhaps this job ‘wasn’t the right fit’ for me. For some reason all I could hear in that idea was that I was a failure. The idea of failing didn’t bother me necessarily (I dabble in stand-up comedy, always prepared to fail publicly), what bothered me was that I<em> knew</em> how to do my job and to do it well. So for it to not be the ‘right fit’ somehow felt like a character flaw. If it’s not the right fit, then what is? This job required responsibility, communication, problem-solving, project management, teamwork, technical aptitude etc. etc. If I’m not the right fit for this, then that must mean I don’t excel in all these critical soft skills. That of course was the smoking gun.</p> 
					<p>I was having a hard time understanding that I had all these very exceptional soft skills, but strongly disliked the hard skills which the job required. While talking with my manager as we tried to develop a plan for other areas within the business I could work toward to realize a new job path, I kept falling back on the feeling “I think I just really don’t like manufacturing”. That made an intra company position change quite impossible, considering the majority of job availability within our local supply chain was within manufacturing. </p>
					<p>Every moment of my work-day was consumed with disinterest. When asking around with my friends how they considered themselves on the ‘happy’ scale with their work, the majority answered that they were either fine, happy, or happy considering its work!  Even now I’m struggling to recall an instance where someone described real misery with their job, except for me of course. I felt like I was the only one experiencing this low. I didn’t find anyone else’s jobs dream-worthy and could often conjure up examples of how they should feel just as miserable as me (without expressing that to them of course).  When I would inquire about certain aspects of their jobs that sounded like a nightmare, they would always respond with similar sentiments of “I just don’t really think about it, it’s just a second-nature part of the job”. </p>

								<i class="fas fa-globe-americas"></i>

					<p>I was reading so many articles where millennials were quitting their jobs because of stress and pressure, and feeling like they weren’t doing meaningful work. I rejected the idea that I should be clumped into the staggering statistics around young professionals opting out of employment, because it felt so painfully privileged and entitled. I have numerous peers who are struggling to make ends meet, and here I was considering the idea of just quitting what seemed like a full-ride. Where could I expect to find meaningful work if I currently only perceive my med student friends to be meeting that ideal? I could start volunteering more if I was so eager to make a difference in the world. Well, I should be volunteering more regardless, but my mistake in this train of thought was concluding that helping others was the only thing that constituted meaningful work. </p> 
					<p>While reading about the millennials-wanting-meaningful-work dilemma, I noted some valuable advice to try focusing attention on <em>fulfilling</em>-work rather than meaningful-work. Instead of desiring work that fits some profound context, consider work that will give you immediate instances of fulfillment. To feel fulfilled was a simple suggestion. Consider the types of tasks you enjoy, and find work that predominately involves those tasks. This made more sense to me when I considered the tasks in my job that I liked and didn’t like. The tasks I didn’t like were very applied, hard skills, that were so specific to the industry and line-of-work. For example, I realized I liked using soft skills like technical aptitude, but disliked the hard skill of trouble-shooting why a lipstick had a particular defect (trust me, it’s a hard, hard skill). </p> 
					<p>The idea to chase fulfillment rather than meaning left me with a decision. I couldn’t stay in my job when I knew I was no longer giving it my all - that wouldn’t be fair to me or my employer, especially when there are others starving for the opportunity. But I wanted to take a breath and really think about what I would find fulfilling before haphazardly jumping into a job just for the sake of it. I was already exhausted and burnt out, and I’m only in my mid-twenties, I didn’t need to empty the tank with so much more road ahead. </p>
					<p>It was the most difficult decision to make, leaving my job for indefinite unemployment. Only months before I had finally paid off my student loans and there were other factors pushing on my family that made financial fall-back on my parents unfair. I had to consider that if I am making this decision, I need to be able to fully support myself and have a reasonable time-frame before it’s time to just forget the empty tank and start walking. </p>

							<i class="fas fa-keyboard"></i>

					<p>I thought about how I should challenge an earlier notion I had about myself – that I could never work in tech. I hated my programming class in first year but when I tried to remember why, it had little to do with the actual programming part. It was because I was in this new, foreign place where I no longer felt special for being intelligent and had to completely re-learn how to learn. I can now with humour recollect that in my first year, I had not yet learned the vital most important aspect of learning… patience. </p>
					<p>What I remember hating was not the programming part, but rather hating how everyone seemed to already know something two steps ahead of the lesson. I remember hating that while we were studying, everyone else was grasping the concepts faster than me and they were completing practice questions in a way that appeared effortless. I wasn’t learning anything, because I wasn’t focusing on anything other than how dumb I felt. Of course, they were moving faster than me, they were actually studying! </p>
					<p>So, I left my job, and hit the drawing board. I researched bootcamps that teach tech skills and wow, are they expensive. Like, I might as well get a degree for that price… I don’t even know if I like it yet! </p>
					<p>I enrolled in a relatively low cost online bootcamp which stood out to me because their mission seemed genuine and their reviews had high praise. I started the course and was immediately consumed with wanting to learn more, and wanting to challenge myself even further with more information and complex problems. I started reading online for more practice opportunities, bought textbooks, and have been overwhelmed by how much I’m learning even though I feel like I’ve only just touched the surface. </p>
					<p>Suddenly it became so clear what fulfilling work feels like. I can’t recall having this feeling since school, where I am working on something and have completely lost track of time. Well actually there were plenty of times at work where I lost track of time, but I always came out of my zone-outs stressed, drained, impatient and annoyed. Now when I’m working on something, however mundane and minor, I feel <em>transfixed</em>, rather than bothered. Feeling accomplished within the day seems far more regulated when completing tasks now. I found that sense of feat very hard to pinpoint in my previous job. Knowing that I am very detail-oriented, it makes sense that I enjoy writing and reviewing code, but something that I can’t quite articulate is how satisfying it is to have that ‘second-nature’ instinct in motion when working through a problem. It’s funny that I’m now feeling so content in what I’m doing – describing those hard skills to my roommate, she chalks it up as <span>her</span> ‘nightmare’. </p>
					<p>Here’s the utmost fitting excerpt from an essay (<span>Heart Museum</span>) by one of my favourite writers, Durga Chew-Bose. She can better, and unknowingly, describe my unarticulated feelings:<i class="fas fa-feather"></i></p>
					<blockquote>“…There’s might too in the incomplete. In feeling fractional. A failure to carry out is perhaps no failure at all, but rather a minced metric of splendor. The ongoing. The out-lawed. The no-patrol. The act of making loose. Of not doing as you’ve been told. Of betting on miscalculations and cul-de-sacs. Why force conciliation when, from time to time, long-held deep breaths follow what we consider defeat? Why not want a little mania? The shrill of chance, of what’s weird. Of purple hats and hiccups. Endurance is a talent that seldom worries about looking good, and abiding has its virtues even when the tongue dries. The intentions shouldn’t only be to polish what we start but to acknowledge that beginning again and again can possess the acquisitive thrill of a countdown that never reaches zero. “ </blockquote>
					<p>When I first set-up a timeline for myself upon leaving my job, I wanted to try and keep the structure of a regular work-week with weekends still to have as a break. I use to LIVE for the weekends. Everyone does I’m sure, but I mean I really lived for the weekends. Even in school I wanted to have a designated, compartmentalized time where I could be ‘guilt-free’ for not doing work. I find that line completely blurred now. I have always, ALWAYS, compartmentalized my life, and now I find myself eager to keep working on a problem into the night or swap my reading book for a technical one on the weekends. </p>
					<p>I don’t expect the excitement to remain at the same all-time high everyday especially within a workplace environment, but damn… it’s a good place to re-start.</p>
